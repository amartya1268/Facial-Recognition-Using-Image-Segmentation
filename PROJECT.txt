The scientific method used to convert an image into digital form and perform some operations on it,
 in order to get an enhanced, improved and detailed image or to extract some useful information from it 
is called “Image Processing”.This process is a type of signal dispensation in which input is image, 
like video frame or photograph and output may be image or characteristics associated with that image. 
Usually Image Processing system includes treating images as two dimensional signals while applying already 
set signal processing methods to them.It is among rapidly growing technologies today, with its applications 
in various aspects of a business as well as science and research.Image Processing forms core research area
 within engineering and computer science disciplines too.
Human activity is a major concern in a wide variety of applications such as video surveillance, 
human computer interface, face recognition and face database management. Detecting faces is a crucial step 
in these identification applications. Most face recognition algorithms assume that the face location is known. 
Similarly, face-tracking algorithms often assume the initial face location is known. Note that face detection 
can be viewed as a two-class (face vs. non-face) classification problem. Therefore, some techniques developed 
for face recognition have also been used to detect faces, but they are very computationally demanding and cannot 
handle large variations in face images. These approaches utilize techniques such as principle component analysis, 
neural network, machine leaming, information theory, geometrical modeling, (deformable) template matching, Hough 
transform, motion extraction, and color analysis. The neural network-based approaches and view-based approaches
 require a large number of face and non-face training samples, and are designed primarily to locate frontal faces
 in gayscale images.
